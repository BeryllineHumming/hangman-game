Fun Fact: The first (unpublished) version contained both an English and Japanese version of the game, complete with a hiragana keyboard. However, after testing the game several times, I realized that Hangman isn't compatible with Japanese. This is due to two things: first, the size of the Japanese syllabary (about three times the size of the alphabet when including diacritics); second, unlike English, where every word must have at least one of five letters (A, E, I, O, U), Japanese words can consist of pretty much any letter in its syllabary. This makes guessing words almost impossible, even with a hint provided, thus making the game unplayable. Alas!
